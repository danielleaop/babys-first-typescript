Welcome, welcome...
I am Danielle and I've been tasked with helping that wonderful, terrible creature above, Stitch, with Typescript.
TypeScript is the BIG SISTER of JavaScript that adds static types, enabling developers to catch errors during development rather than at runtime. It supports all JavaScript features but adds type safety, interfaces, and generics, making code more predictable and maintainable in large projects.
Stitch is a great programmer but quite lazy, follow along with this README on your browser and let's show him how it's done!

## before we so much as dare begin this task...
- It is very important that you know some basic JavaScript. 
- It is also important that you have Typescript installed on your computer! You can use `tsc --version` to check if you do! If not, use `npm install -g typescript` to install and try again.
- Once that's done, FORK this repo with all branches. You can use the branches provided to check your solutions and help yourself if you get stuck!

## first things first...
1. once you open up the repo in your code editor of choice, you should see this README file and lazy Stitch's .js file
2. change this .js file to a .ts file
3. now use the command `tsc name-of-file.ts` to compile a .js file
4. you should see quite a few errors, let's try and help Stitch by correcting his .ts file (**NOT THE .JS FILE!!**)


## PROBLEM ONE
As you can see, Stitch is trying to evaluate his horrid vibe levels... not looking too great, I'm afraid. 

Now, I know you see the errors. Let's try and use Typescript to establish rules first.
1. use `: type` notation at the end of each to make it clear what type each parameter and the function itself. (use the examples listed here https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#functions if you don't know how.)
2. now you can correct the errors
