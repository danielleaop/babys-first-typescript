Welcome, welcome...
I am Danielle and I've been tasked with helping a wonderful, terrible creature called Stitch with Typescript.
He's a great programmer but quite lazy, follow along with this README on your browser and let's show him how it's done!

## before we so much as dare begin this task...
It is very important that you know some basic JavaScript. 
It is also important that you have Typescript installed on your computer! You can use `tsc --version` to check if you do! If not, use `npm install -g typescript` to install and try again.
Once that's done, FORK this repo with all branches. You can use the branches provided to check your solutions and help yourself if you get stuck!

## first things first...
- once you open up the repo in your code editor of choice, you should see this README file and lazy Stitch's .js file
- change this .js file to a .ts file
- now use the command `tsc name-of-file.ts` to compile a .js file
- you should see quite a few errors, let's try and help Stitch by correcting his .ts file (NOT THE .JS FILE!!)
